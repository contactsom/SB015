Overloading:
    1. Operator Overloading
    2. Method Overloading
    3. Constructor Overloading

Overriding :
    1. Method Overriding
    2. Constructor Overriding


Two Methods are said tobe overloaded IFF:
    1. Method name should be same
    2. Method Argument must be different

    NOTES:
        In Python method overloading are NOT Possible
        If we are trying to declare the multiple method with in same name and different number of arguments
        then Python will always CONSIDER THE LAST METHOD ONLY.

        We can not perform the Method Overloading in simple way.
        We have to take a help from if..... elif....else  Condition
